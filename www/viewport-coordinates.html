<h2>Viewport Coordinates</h2>
<p>OpenSeadragon zooms your images to fit into your webpage. To do this, it uses three coordinate systems: Image, Page, and Viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Image</strong> coordinates are the actual pixels of your image. If the image is 1000px wide, its left side is at x = 0, and its right side is x = 1000.</p>
<p><strong>Page</strong> coordinates are the normal "pixel" coordinates of the webpage. Note that this may not be actual screen pixels, if you're on a "retina" display.</p>
<p><strong>Viewport</strong> coordinates are an arbitrary coordinate system that OpenSeadragon uses to allow you to lay things out, and to be a neutral space between image and page coordinates. They allow you to forget about how many pixels are in your image, and just think in terms of relative locations (i.e. halfway down the image).</p>
<p>By default, a single image will be placed with its left side at viewport x = 0 and its right side at viewport x = 1. The default top is at at viewport y = 0 and its bottom is wherever is appropriate for the image's aspect ratio. For instance, the bottom of a square image would be at y = 1, but the bottom of an image that's twice as wide as it is tall would be at y = 0.5.</p>
<p>Viewport coordinates become more interesting with multiple images in the same viewer. When you open the images, or add them later, you can specify x, y, and either width or height. If you specify the width, it will set the height automatically based on the aspect ratio; likewise for width if you specify height. It's entirely up to you where and how big you place your images, regardless of their resolution. You can mix high-resolution and low-resolution images side by side.</p>
<p>Different OpenSeadragon functions work with different systems; for instance, the <a href="/docs/OpenSeadragon.MouseTracker.html">MouseTracker</a> generally deals with page coordinates, whereas the <a href="/docs/OpenSeadragon.Viewport.html">Viewport</a> generally deals with viewport coordinates. The documentation for each function should make it clear. If you need to convert between coordinate systems, Viewport and <a href="/docs/OpenSeadragon.TiledImage.html">TiledImage</a> have functions that do so.</p>
